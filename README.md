# Snippets
### What this repo is for?
This repository will contain my common code snippets, 

I'll try to always make it up to date, clean and handy.

Any contribution is welcome.


### How it's arranged?
Codes are separated in different folders, according to their language as they are easy in most cases and or not multi-lang.

And are separated in subfolders according to their scope, subject or technology.

Also, they will get c (common), r (rare), l (legendary) according to the complexity of that subject.

E.g python/mongo/c_dbConnection.py


### References?
Any code snippet might have some references to read and learn more.

### Any folder and subfolder has it's own readme for more detailes
